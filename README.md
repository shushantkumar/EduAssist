## **EduAssist: Interactive Learning Through Automated Playbooks & Assessments**

## Short Description
duAssist transforms any educational PDF into interactive learning modules with chapter-wise playbooks and adaptive assessments for a personalized learning experience.

## Long Description:
In the realm of education, the transition from traditional to digital learning has been both a challenge and an opportunity. EduAssist addresses a critical gap in this transition by offering an innovative solution that converts static educational content into dynamic learning experiences. Our platform allows users to upload PDFs, which can range from structured textbooks to unstructured lesson notes. Utilizing advanced text extraction and natural language processing, EduAssist performs a chapter discovery process to identify and organize content into structured chapters. 

For each chapter, it then generates comprehensive playbooks that serve as detailed guides, enhancing students' understanding of the concepts in a structured manner. To reinforce learning, EduAssist creates a variety of question types (MCQ, MAQ, True/False, Fill in the Blanks, Numericals) across three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), providing a tailored assessment experience. This approach not only aids in knowledge retention but also prepares students for various evaluation formats. 

The platform includes a dashboard for both students and teachers, offering insights into performance, areas for improvement, and progress tracking. EduAssist is designed for educators looking to enrich their teaching materials and students seeking a more engaging and effective way to learn. By bridging the gap between static content and interactive learning, EduAssist aims to revolutionize the educational landscape.
